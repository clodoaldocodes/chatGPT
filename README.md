# chatGPT
 
This repository contains a Python script for generating text responses using GPT-3.5-turbo, a language model trained on a massive corpus of text data. The script uses the Hugging Face transformers library to set up the tokenizer and model for GPT-3.5-turbo, and allows the user to interact with ChatGPT by entering prompts and receiving generated responses.

To run the script, you will need to install the following libraries using pip:

torch
transformers
requests
To install these libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install torch transformers requests
```

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the script by navigating to the directory containing the script and running the following command in your terminal:

```
python gptMain.py
```

The script will download the necessary data files if they are not already present in the "downloaded_data" folder, and then prompt the user to enter a message for ChatGPT to respond to. ChatGPT will generate a response based on the input prompt and display it in the terminal. The user can then enter another prompt to continue the conversation.
